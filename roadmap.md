# TSpec Project Roadmap

> **TSpec** - A comprehensive TypeScript testing framework designed to simplify testing for TypeScript developers with zero-config setup, native TypeScript support, and powerful features for complex testing scenarios.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a modern, TypeScript-first testing framework that provides:
- **Zero-config setup** for basic TypeScript testing
- **Native TypeScript support** with full type safety
- **Multiple testing types**: Unit, Integration, E2E
- **Advanced features**: Database testing, HTTP mocking, parallel execution
- **Developer-friendly experience** with excellent tooling and documentation
